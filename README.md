# Pizza-Sales----SQL

Description:
This project explores the analysis of pizza sales data through a series of SQL queries categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced tasks. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights from sales data by leveraging SQL for data extraction, aggregation, and transformation.

Key Questions Addressed:

Basic:

--Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

--Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

--Identify the highest-priced pizza.

--Determine the most common pizza size ordered.

--List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Intermediate:

--Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered by joining relevant tables.
--Analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
--Derive the category-wise distribution of pizzas through table joins.
--Group orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
--Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Advanced:

--Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to the total revenue.
--Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
--Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

Skills Demonstrated:

SQL querying techniques: SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, WHERE, HAVING.
Data aggregation with functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT.
Advanced SQL features such as subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions.
Insight generation through data manipulation and visualization-ready outputs.

This project highlights the application of SQL to a real-world scenario, providing a clear demonstration of data analysis capabilities.
